# GraphSAGE_pytorch
Self implementation (leanring purpose) of GraphSAGE (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/5dd9db5e033da9c6fb5ba83c7a7ebea9-Abstract.html) based on 2 repos: 

(Pytorch) https://github.com/williamleif/graphsage-simple/

(Tensorflow) https://github.com/williamleif/GraphSAGE

In this torch version, I have added MeanAggregator, MaxAggregator, GCNAggregator, MaxPoolAggregator, MeanPoolAggregator and TwoMaxLayerPoolingAggregator. SeqAggregator (LSTM) is to be added.
